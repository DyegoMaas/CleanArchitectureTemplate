# Encyclopedia Galactica - Project Specifications

The library contains only hand-picked books in text form, chosen by a select group of Editors. The Editors are the only ones who can manage the library's content as they see fit.

A fellow reader can lend as many books as she want, and the library tracks reading behavior.
