This repository is heavily inspired by Jason Taylor's [Clean Architecture Template](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture), with several changes that aim to to make it easier to use and more accessible to all kinds of developers.

## Premises

This template shall be a fully operational application. In other words, it will be deployed in a _TBF_ host, and subject to a complete continuous delivery pipeline.

The application will use a very pragmatic and opinionated version of the Clean Architecture.

Code coverage will have to be high, but the focus will be on a good mutation score.

Replication should be easy. 

This template will serve as a test subject for better understanding the concept of _replicable repositories_.

## Examples

This project comes packed with examples which implement services for a fictional library.

The project specification can be found in the [docs here](docs/ProjectSpecifications.md).
