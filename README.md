**This repository aims to be as easy to replicate as possible.** It should turn the process of creating new applications based in this template a no-brainer, very smooth.

For the replication process, it will work in tandem with another of my OSS projects, [Replicante](https://github.com/DyegoMaas/replicante), which may receive upgrades in the near future to better support replication of remote repositories.

## Premises

This template shall be a fully operational application. In other words, it will be deployed in a _TBF_ host, and subject to a complete continuous delivery pipeline.

The application will use a very pragmatic and opinionated version of the Clean Architecture.

Code coverage will have to be high, but the focus will be on a good mutation score.

Replication should be easy. 

This template will serve as a test subject for better understanding the concept of _replicable repositories_.
